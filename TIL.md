### Shell: Get the status code of any command in a pipeline

Tags: `shell` `bash` `zsh`

When you run commands in a pipeline, `$?` only tells you the exit status of the last command in the pipeline.

If you need the exit code of a command earlier in a pipeline, you can use the `$PIPESTATUS` array:

```
#!/bin/bash
grep some.machine.example.com /etc/hosts 2>&1 | tee /tmp/hosts-results.txt
if [ "${PIPESTATUS[0]}" -ne "0" ]; then
  # The grep command failed to find "some.machine.example.com" in /etc/hosts file
  echo "I don't know the IP address of some.machine.example.com"
  exit 2
fi
```

### Git: If a subrepo breaks due to rebasing in the upstream subrepo, force re-cloning it is the simplest resolution

Tags: `git` `subrepo`

With git subrepo, you can force reclone a subrepo with `-f`, if you hit [issues with rebases breaking subrepo's tracking of parentage](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo/issues/348).

### Shell: Include comments in multi-line commands

Tags: `shell` `bash` `zsh`

Backtick command substitution can be abused in order to include comments in multi-line commands, where the continuation slash needing to be the last character, and lines needing to be adjacent, would otherwise preclude adding comments:

```shell
echo CommandName InputFiles `#1st comment` \
             --option1 arg1 `#2nd comment` \
             --option2 arg2 `#3rd comment`
```

### OS X: Copy HTML to the clipboard as HTML

Tags: `osx` `clipboard`

It can be useful to copy HTML to the clipboard with a HTML data type, so that applications that accept HTML clipboard content accept it correctly (rather than as the HTML as text).

It's possible to add a HTML string to the clipboard as a HTML copy type by using a hexdumped version with AppleScript:

```shell
hex=`echo -n "your html code here" | hexdump -ve '1/1 "%.2x"'`
osascript -e "set the clipboard to «data HTML${hex}»"
```

### Loop until a command is successful

Tags: `shell` `bash`

`until` can be used to run commands until a given command no longer fails.

### Jira Wiki markup for new-style panels

Tags: `jira`

Jira panels are really nice for organising issue descriptions.

In older versions of Jira, these panels could be custom styled with Wiki markup.

In the newer versions of Jira rich text editors, the panel styles are more limited.

The follow Wiki markup panels map to the new-style panels.

```
{panel:bgColor=#ffebe6}
This error panel
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#deebff}
This info panel
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#e3fcef}
This success panel
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#fefae6}
This warning panel
{panel}

{panel:bgColor=#eae6ff}
This note panel
{panel}
```

### Debugging faulty extensions in VSCode

Tags: `vscode`

From the `...` context menu in the extensions pane, there's an option to "Start Extension Bisect".

VSCode will run a `git bisect`-like halving of enabled extensions (by disabling half), and you to perform any actions to identify undesired behaviour, then report whether the set of enabled extensions is good or bad. This is repeated until the offending extension(s) are identified.

Handy!

### Debugging a hanging Terraform plan

Tags: `terraform`

Via https://alexwlchan.net/2019/01/debugging-a-stuck-terraform-plan/

Stop endless attempted connections to AWS APIs that are exhibiting issues (permissions or otherwise):

```terraform
provider "aws" {
  # other settings
  max_retries = 1
}
```

The [behaviour](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#max_retries) of retrying with `max_retries` can cause very long hangs where API(s) are not accessible:

> The delay between the subsequent API calls increases exponentially. If omitted, the default value is 25.

### Building the RDKit minimal JS library

Tags: `rdkit` `docker` `wasm` `javascript`

The [minimal RDKit JS build](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Code/MinimalLib) (emscripten compiled to WASM) allows a lot of cheminformatics work (including [2D depictions, fingerprint generation and similarity searching](http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2019/11/introducing-new-rdkit-javascript.html)) to be done in the browser.

### Building the library

Using Docker it's easy to build the library using a single [Dockerfile](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/blob/master/Code/MinimalLib/docker/Dockerfile).

If the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/blob/master/Code/MinimalLib/docker/Dockerfile) is placed on it's own in a folder, build with:

```shell
docker build -t rdkitjs . 
```

The build will take some time...  ☕️

The built JS and WASM file can then be copied out of a running instance of the container:

```shell
CONTAINER_ID=$(docker run -d rdkitjs sleep 20)
docker cp $CONTAINER_ID:/src/rdkit/build/Code/MinimalLib/RDKit_minimal.js .
docker cp $CONTAINER_ID:/src/rdkit/build/Code/MinimalLib/RDKit_minimal.wasm .
docker stop $CONTAINER_ID
docker rm $CONTAINER_ID
```

### Using the library

Use in your web app with

```html
<script src="<path/to>/RDKit_minimal.js"></script>
```

It may be a good idea to add cache-buster to the filename, so that the large-ish (~4.3 MB without gzip) RDKit WASM can be cached with a long lifetime.

If you do, you'll need to rename both the JS and WASM file, and in the JS file, find:

```javascript
wasmBinaryFile="RDKit_minimal.wasm"
```

and replace the filename with your altered name.

When loaded, an `initRDKitModule` function is added to `window`. `window.initRDKitModule` returns a `Promise`, which resolves to a handler object for RDKit functionality.

Example Typescript wrapper around `initRDKitModule`:


```typescript
const setupRDKit = async () => {
  let rdkit

  try {
    rdkit = await (window as any).initRDKitModule()
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      console.log('RDKit initialized')
    }
    (window as any).rdkit = rdkit
    return rdkit
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error initializing RDKit', error)
  }
}

export default setupRDKit
```

Using the above, check out `window.rdkit` in browser development tools to see the functionality available. `window.rdkit.get_mol` allows you to get a molecule from e.g. SMILES; that `Mol` object provides further methods such as `get_svg`.

### Pi-hole Caddy config with SSL / TLS with Cloudflare

Tags: `caddy` `dns` `cloudflare` `pihole`

Hosting sites on a local network with SSL (using the Cloudflare DNS validation module for ACME / Let'sEncrypt validation) on a [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) DHCP / DNS managed network with Caddy: can be tricky as making a local DNS record can throw Caddy's DNS validation off.

In this very specific case, rather than giving a limited config:

```
tls {env.ACME_EMAIL} { 
  dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
}
```

A full config can be provided giving resolvers to use for DNS validation:

```
example.com {
    root * /var/caddy/example.com
    file_server
    tls {
        issuer acme {
            dir https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
            dns cloudflare <api_token>
            resolvers 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1
        }
    }
}
```

### Site-wide Python install customisations

Tags: `python` `administration`

You can customise a Python install as a system administrator by creating a `sitecustomize` module in the install's `site-packages` directory, and including code to be applied on every Python run there.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html

You can use this to do things like globally opt out of SSL verification (not that you should in the vast majority of cases!)

### Quick SSL certificates in a pinch

Tags: `ssl` `letsencrypt` `certbot` `docker`

If you need a certificate quickly (and free) and you're not able to set up automated Let'sEncrypt renewal, you can grab a three month valid certificate by running Certbot manually in Docker, e.g.

```
docker run -it --rm --name certbot \
            -v "$(pwd)/etc:/etc/letsencrypt" \
            -v "$(pwd)/lib:/var/lib/letsencrypt" \
            certbot/certbot -d '*.domain.com' --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly
```

Certbot will interactively take you through validating via setting a DNS `TXT` record manually. The certificates live in `etc/live/domain.com` on your host system (from the `pwd` bind mount), will last for three months. `fullchain.pem` is the full certificate chain used for web servers, `privkey.pem` is the private key.

### Postgres template databases

Tags: `postgres` `database`

You can update the default template database, `template1`, by running commands against it (e.g. `CREATE EXTENSION`). Subsequent created databases will be based off of the updated `template1`, which is handy for setting defaults for all creating databases to inherit.

If you mess up `template1` somehow, it can be restored to it's original setup from the uneditable `template0` database.

### Dynamically import from folders with Webpack

Tags: `javascript` `typescript` `webpack` `frontend`

If you have a folder of files you want to import at build-time, Webpack can traverse the folder structure for you and import them. For example, to import every Vue file (assuming you're using a Vue Webpack loader):

```javascript
const cache = {}

function importAll (r) {
  r.keys().forEach(key => { cache[key] = r(key) })
}

importAll(require.context('./plugins', true, /\.vue$/))
```

`cache` has key:value pairs of filename: `Module`.

In Vue for example, this can be used to import a large set of components without importing them all individually or maintaining a manifest:

```typescript
const plugins = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(cache).map(([filename, esModule]) => [
    esModule.default.name, esModule.default
  ])
)

export default Vue.extend({
  name: 'Plugins',
  components: {
    ...plugins
  }
})
```

### Dynamic configuration of Dockerised nginx

Tags: `nginx` `docker` `bash` `shell` `*nix`

If you want to bake an `nginx` config into a Docker image, and/or dynamically set configuration in a volume mounted config, you can have the `COMMAND` for the container use [**`envsubst`**](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/envsubst-Invocation.html) to substitute in environment variable values in the config before the `nginx` process is started, for example in a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
web:
  image: nginx
  volumes:
   - ./mysite.template:/etc/nginx/conf.d/mysite.template
  ports:
   - "8080:80"
  environment:
   - NGINX_HOST=foobar.com
   - NGINX_PORT=80
  command: /bin/bash -c "envsubst < /etc/nginx/conf.d/mysite.template > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && exec nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
```

### Use a custom `GraphQLView` for better traceback handling

Tags: `python` `django` `graphql` `graphene` `graphene-django`

When using [Graphene-Django](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django) to use GraphQL with Django, GraphQL swallows your error messages and tracebacks, making it more difficult to debug exceptions in resolvers.

There is a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django/issues/124) discussing the problem, a number of solutions are suggested including using middleware, however middleware has the caveat that it has to be applied individually on each request.

A generally applicable solution is subclassing `GraphQLView` and adding back the traceback there (adapted from [Martin Samami on Medium](https://medium.com/@martin.samami/make-graphene-django-and-sentry-exceptions-work-together-f796be60a901) adding Sentry logging):

```python3
import traceback
from pprint import pprint
from graphene_django.views import GraphQLView


class ErrorLoggingGraphQLView(GraphQLView):
    """
    GraphQL view that logs errors better for easier debugging.

    https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django/issues/124#issuecomment-368283927
    https://medium.com/@martin.samami/make-graphene-django-and-sentry-exceptions-work-together-f796be60a901
    """

    def execute_graphql_request(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """Extract any exceptions and log them better than the default"""
        result = super().execute_graphql_request(*args, **kwargs)
        if result.errors:
            for error in result.errors:
                try:
                    raise error.original_error
                except Exception as original_error:
                    pprint(original_error)
                    traceback.print_exc()
        return result
```

Then in your `urls.py`:

```python3
from django.urls import include, path
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
from your_schema_location import schema
from your_module import ErrorLoggingGraphQLView

urlpatterns = [
    path(
        "graphql/", csrf_exempt(ErrorLoggingGraphQLView.as_view(schema=schema, graphiql=True))
    ),
]
```

### Get an alert when terminal commands finish

Tags: `bash` `zsh`

When running a long terminal command, it would be nice to be able to do something else while it runs, but be notified when it's finished.

The following `bash`/`zsh` function rings the terminal bell when the command passed to it either finishes or fails:

```bash
function ring () {
	($@ && tput bel) || tput bel
}
```

`ring` could also be adapted to send a notification with a custom message, using e.g. Applescript `osascript`.

Alternatively, there are richer solutions, such as [NotiFyre](https://github.com/kaustubhhiware/NotiFyre).

### Default override configuration

Tags: `docker` `docker-compose`

`docker-compose.override.yml` is read by `docker-compose` by default, laid on top of `docker-compose.yml`.

Using `docker-compose.override.yml` allows for use cases where, for example, an image is built locally for development, but pulled in production: the build (placed in `docker-compose.override.yml`) can be avoided entirely with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.production.yml` to exclude the `override` entirely.

### Use new `typing` features in older versions of Python

Tags: `python` `python3.5` `python3.6` `python3.7` `python3.8` `typing`

New accepted or experimental `typing` PEPs are backported to older versions of Python that already included `typing` in the standard library on a provisional basis, via the [`typing_extensions` PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/).

```pip install typing-extensions```

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3.6

from typing_extensions import Literal
```

`typing_extensions` allows you to use e.g. types added in Python 3.8 in Python 3.7 or 3.6, for example `typing.Literal`. 

For versions older than 3.5 (before `typing` was added to the standard library), there is also the `typing` module on PyPI to backport `typing` to those versions.

### Typed dictionaries

Tags: `python` `python3.8` `typing`

[PEP-589]() adds support for typing dictionaries requiring a fixed set of string keys with specific value types.

Example from the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict):

```python3
class Point2D(TypedDict):
    x: int
    y: int
    label: str

a: Point2D = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'label': 'good'}  # OK
b: Point2D = {'z': 3, 'label': 'bad'}           # Fails type check
```

### Literal typing

Tags: `python` `python3.8` `typing`

[PEP-586](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0586/) adds support for type annotations where literal values are expected.

Example from the PEP:

```python3
from typing import Literal

def accepts_only_four(x: Literal[4]) -> None:
    pass

accepts_only_four(4)   # OK
accepts_only_four(19)  # Rejected
```
